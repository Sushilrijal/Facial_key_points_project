# Facial Key Point Detection
## Overview
This project features a facial key point detection system using a modified VGG16 architecture. It identifies key facial points, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, from images. Built with PyTorch, it utilizes transfer learning for efficient and accurate inference.

## Features
- **Modified VGG16 Architecture**: Utilizes a tailored version of the VGG16 model for enhanced performance in facial key point detection.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Automatically resizes and normalizes images for optimal model input.
- **Key Point Prediction**: Outputs the coordinates of key facial points for any given input image.
